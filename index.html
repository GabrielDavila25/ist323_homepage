        <h2>Career Goal</h2>
        <p>Hello World! My name is Gabriel Davila, and I have a deep interest in space. My goal is to become a data scientist at NASA. I'm on a journey to develop the skills needed to contribute to space exploration and security through data-driven insights. Space is a vast and challenging frontier, and I hope to be part of the team that keeps it safe and accessible for everyone. While I'm still learning, I’m committed to doing my best, and each step I take brings me closer to understanding the complex data and uncovering patterns that can help us protect our universe.</p>

        <h2>Interest in Information Security</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can empower us, but I also recognize the risks involved. My background is in data science, but I've found myself increasingly drawn to the field of information security, especially when it comes to space. The idea that satellites, which are essential for everything from GPS to global communications, could be vulnerable to cyberattacks is both intriguing and concerning. I believe that diving deeper into these security challenges is just as important as exploring new worlds.</p>

        <h2>Preferred Security Presentation Topic</h2>
        <p>
            For my upcoming presentation, I plan to explore the topic of cyber operations targeting space systems, based on the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2024" target="_blank" style="color: #ffcc00; text-decoration: underline;">“Space Threat Assessment 2024”</a> report. This topic feels especially relevant as our reliance on space-based technologies continues to grow. The implications of a compromised satellite could be severe, with potential disruptions to communications and navigation systems. Right now, I’m keeping my options open for the start date, but I’m looking forward to sharing insights that could contribute to important discussions about the future of space security.

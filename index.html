        <h2>Career Goal</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m Gabriel Davila, and I’m driven by a deep fascination with space. My ultimate dream? To become a data scientist at NASA. I’m passionate about exploring the unknown and contributing to the advancement of space exploration and security through data-driven insights. Space is the final frontier, and I want to be part of the team that makes sure it stays safe and accessible for everyone. My journey so far has been focused on building the skills needed to analyze complex data and uncover patterns that can help us understand—and protect—our universe.</p>

        <h2>Interest in Information Security</h2>
        <p>Now, you might wonder, “Why security?” While my academic background is in data science, I’ve developed a strong and growing interest in the field of information security—especially as it relates to space. I’ve always been intrigued by how technology can both empower and endanger us. The idea that our satellites, which we rely on for everything from GPS to global communications, could be vulnerable to cyberattacks is something that truly fascinates (and motivates) me. I believe that understanding these threats is just as important as exploring new worlds, and that’s why I’m eager to dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity.</p>

    <section id="presentation-topic">
        <h2>Preferred Security Presentation Topic</h2>
        <p>For my upcoming presentation, I’d love to explore the topic of cyber operations targeting space systems, based on the “Space Threat Assessment 2024” report. This topic is not just timely, but also crucial as our reliance on space-based technologies grows. Imagine the implications if a critical satellite were compromised—communications could be disrupted, navigation systems thrown off course, and the ripple effects could be felt globally. My preferred date for the presentation is September 20, 2024, and I’m excited to share insights that could spark important discussions about the future of space security.</p>

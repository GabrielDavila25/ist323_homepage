        <h2>Career Goal</h2>
        <p>Hello World! I'm Gabe, and I’ve always been fascinated by space and what it represents for our future. My goal is to become a data scientist at NASA, a role where I can contribute to the advancement of space exploration and security. I'm on a journey to develop the skills needed to make a meaningful impact in this field, and I believe that every small step brings me closer to that goal. Space is a vast and challenging frontier, and the idea of working to keep it safe and accessible for everyone is something that drives me. While I’m still learning and growing, I’m committed to doing my best with every opportunity I get. Each experience is a chance to deepen my understanding of complex data and to uncover patterns that could help us protect our universe in ways we haven't yet imagined.</p>

        <h2>Interest in Information Security</h2>
        <p>Technology has always intrigued me, especially its dual ability to empower and to present new challenges. My background is in data science, but I've found myself increasingly drawn to information security, particularly as it relates to space. The idea that satellites, which are critical for everything from GPS to global communications, could be vulnerable to cyberattacks is both fascinating and concerning to me. It’s a reminder that as we push the boundaries of what’s possible, we also need to be vigilant about the risks. I believe that diving deeper into these security challenges is just as important as exploring new worlds, and I’m eager to learn more and contribute to this critical area.</p>

    <section id="presentation-topic">
        <h2>Preferred Security Presentation Topic</h2>
        <p>
            For my upcoming presentation, I plan to explore the topic of cyber operations targeting space systems, based on the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2024" target="_blank" style="color: #ffcc00; text-decoration: underline;">“Space Threat Assessment 2024”</a> report. This topic feels especially relevant as our reliance on space-based technologies continues to grow rapidly. The implications of a compromised satellite could be severe, with potential disruptions to communications, navigation systems, and even global security. Right now, I want to schedule my Individual Security Presentation for the 10/2/2024 time slot, I also want to add that I’m really looking forward to sharing insights that could contribute to important discussions about the future of space security. I believe this is a conversation that needs to happen as we increasingly depend on these technologies.
